The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=627133).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Reporting Data Retention Time Periods](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt573270.aspx).
