A score from 0.0 to 1.0 that indicates the percentage of pages in the requested language that belong to a particular domain out of all the pages that Bing has indexed for the same language your website's domain.

In other words coverage is the percentage of webpages that match a category and language divided by the total number of webpages using the same language in the domain.

For example, if the category *US/CA/SFO* matches 500 english webpages and *US/CA* matches 1,000 english webpages, then the coverage will be 0.50 (50 percent).
