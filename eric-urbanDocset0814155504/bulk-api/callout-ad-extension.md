# Callout Ad Extension
Defines a callout ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For a *Callout Ad Extension* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](../bulk-api/bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Schedule](#adschedule)
- [Callout Text](#callouttext)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [End Date](#enddate)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Start Date](#startdate)
- [Status](#status)
- [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone)
- [Version](#version)

You can download all fields of the *Callout Ad Extension* record by including the [DownloadEntity](../bulk-api/downloadentity-value-set.md) value of *CalloutAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](../bulk-api/downloadcampaignsbyaccountids-service-operation.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](../bulk-api/downloadcampaignsbycampaignids-service-operation.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](../bulk-api/datascope-value-set.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](~/concepts/bulk-download-and-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Callout Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Callout Text
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,
Callout Ad Extension,Active,-13,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2018,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,Callout Text
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](~/concepts/bing-ads-client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkCalloutAdExtension* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCallAdExtension
var bulkCalloutAdExtension = new BulkCalloutAdExtension
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // CalloutAdExtension object of the Campaign Management service.
    CalloutAdExtension = new CalloutAdExtension
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = calloutAdExtensionIdKey,
        // 'Ad Schedule' column header in the Bulk file
        Scheduling = new Schedule
        {
            // Each day and time range is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            DayTimeRanges = new[]
            {
                // Within each day and time range the format is Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute].
                new DayTime
                {
                    Day = Day.Monday,
                    StartHour = 9,
                    StartMinute = Minute.Zero,
                    EndHour = 21,
                    EndMinute = Minute.Zero,
                },
            },
            // 'End Date' column header in the Bulk file
            EndDate = new Microsoft.BingAds.V10.CampaignManagement.Date
            {
                Month = 12,
                Day = 31,
                Year = DateTime.UtcNow.Year + 1
            },
            // 'Start Date' column header in the Bulk file
            StartDate = null,
            // 'Use Searcher Time Zone' column header in the Bulk file
            UseSearcherTimeZone = false,
        },
                    
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdExtensionStatus.Active,
        // 'Callout Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "Callout Text",
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCalloutAdExtension);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

### <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, then ad extensions will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar start and end dates.  
**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../bulk-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)] The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. If you do not set this field, then the existing settings will be retained. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively removing all existing day and time ranges.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="callouttext"></a>Callout Text
