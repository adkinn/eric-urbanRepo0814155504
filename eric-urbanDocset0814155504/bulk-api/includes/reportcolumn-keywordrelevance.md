A numeric score that indicates how likely your ads will be clicked and how well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. This score predicts whether your keyword is likely to lead to a click on your ads, taking into account how well your keyword has performed in the past relative to your ad's position.

*KeywordRelevance* is equivalent to the **Expected Click-Through Rate** label used in the Bing Ads web application.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

**Note**: Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.
