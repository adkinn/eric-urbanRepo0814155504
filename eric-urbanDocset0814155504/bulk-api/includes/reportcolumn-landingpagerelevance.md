A numeric score that indicates how relevant your ad and landing page are to the customer's search query or other input.

*LandingPageRelevance* is equivalent to the **Ad Relevance** label used in the Bing Ads web application.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

**Note**: Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.
