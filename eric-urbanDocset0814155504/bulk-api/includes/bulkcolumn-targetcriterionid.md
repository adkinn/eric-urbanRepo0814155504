The Bing Ads unique identifier of the criterion.

**Important:** Previously with Campaign Management API version 10 it was possible to associate one target identifier with multiple campaigns and ad groups using the AddTargetsToLibrary, SetTargetToCampaign, and SetTargetToAdGroup operations. After a campaign or ad group has been disassociated from the shared target, the criterion identifier will be set to *0* (zero) in the Bulk download or Bulk upload result file.
