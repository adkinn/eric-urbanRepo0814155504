# Hotel Feed
> [!NOTE]
> Hotel Ads is now under pilot and available to pilot participants only. Please contact your account manager for details.

If you create hotel ads in Bing, you must use a hotel feed to provide Bing information about the hotels that you advertise. You must define and import your hotel feed prior to sending Bing [Transaction Messages](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md).

To provide Bing your hotel listings, create an XML document that contains a listing of each hotel you want to advertise. A listing describes the hotel's name, address, telephone number, and geographical coordinates. For information about creating the XML document, see the following topics.

|Topic|Description

|[Validating your Hotel Feed](../hotel-feed/validating-your-hotel-feed.md)|Provides information about using the Hotel XSD to validate your feed file.
