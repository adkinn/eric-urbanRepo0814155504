# PHP Examples for Bing Ads
The PHP code examples for [!INCLUDE[brand](../code-examples/includes/brand.md)] are developed and run within the environment described in [Getting Started Using PHP with Bing Ads Services](../Topic/Getting%20Started%20Using%20PHP%20with%20Bing%20Ads%20Services.md). Your custom configuration may vary.

To get started developing Bing Ads applications with PHP, you can download PHP examples with Bing Ads class files at [Code Gallery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=329042).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note the deprecated [PHP Classes for Bing Ads API examples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=329042) will be removed from MSDN at the end of October, so when you [migrate to API version 11](Migrating%20to%20Bing%20Ads%20API%20Version%2011.md) you should [upgrade](Getting%20Started%20Using%20PHP%20with%20Bing%20Ads%20Services.md#upgrade) to the new SDK.
