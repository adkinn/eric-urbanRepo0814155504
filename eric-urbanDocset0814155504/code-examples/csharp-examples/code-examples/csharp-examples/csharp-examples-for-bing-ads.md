# C# Examples for Bing Ads
The C# code examples for [!INCLUDE[brand](../../code-examples/csharp-examples/includes/brand.md)] are developed and run within the environment described in [Getting Started Using C&#35; with Bing Ads Services](../Topic/Getting%20Started%20Using%20C%23%20with%20Bing%20Ads%20Services.md). Your custom configuration may vary. The examples are aligned to the core scenarios described in [Bing Ads Technical Guides](../Topic/Bing%20Ads%20Technical%20Guides.md).
