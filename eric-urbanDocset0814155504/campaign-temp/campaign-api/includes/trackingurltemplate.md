Tracking templates are where you can specify URL tracking parameters that are used in tandem with your final URL or landing page.<br/><br/> We recommend that you add the tracking template at the account level and then it will be applied to all URLs for lower level entities such as campaigns, ad groups, and ads. To learn more, see the Bing Ads help articles [URL Tracking with Upgraded URLs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bing-ads-tracking-template-urls-guide.aspx).
