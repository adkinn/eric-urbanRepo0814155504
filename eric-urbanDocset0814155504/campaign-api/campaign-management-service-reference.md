# Campaign Management Service Reference
The Campaign Management [service](~/concepts/bing-ads-web-service-addresses.md) defines the following Application Programming Interface (API) that you can use to manage your advertising campaigns.

|Interface|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[Campaign Management Service Operations](../campaign-api/campaign-management-service-operations.md)|Service operations such as [AddCampaigns](../campaign-api/addcampaigns-service-operation.md), [AddAds](../campaign-api/addads-service-operation.md) and [AddAdExtensions](../campaign-api/addadextensions-service-operation.md) can be used to add, get, update, and delete campaign data.|
|[Campaign Management Data Objects](../campaign-api/campaign-management-data-objects.md)|You'll find most of the same entity settings that you are used to managing in the Bing Ads web application, for example [Campaign](../campaign-api/campaign-data-object.md), [ExpandedTextAd](../campaign-api/expandedtextad-data-object.md), and [LocationAdExtension](../campaign-api/locationadextension-data-object.md).|
|[Campaign Management Error Data Objects](../campaign-api/campaign-management-error-data-objects.md)|Be sure to [handle](~/concepts/handling-service-errors-and-exceptions.md) errors, for example [OperationError](../campaign-api/operationerror-data-object.md) would be returned if the user credentials cannot be authenticated.|
|[Campaign Management Value Sets](../campaign-api/campaign-management-value-sets.md)|Value sets include [CampaignType](../campaign-api/campaigntype-value-set.md), [AdType](../campaign-api/adtype-value-set.md), and [AdExtensionsTypeFilter](../campaign-api/adextensionstypefilter-value-set.md).
