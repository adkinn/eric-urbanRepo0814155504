> Standard Text Ads have been deprecated in favor of Expanded Text Ads (EXTAs). Support for adding and updating standard text ads (STAs) ended on July 31, 2017. Now, advertisers can get and delete, but can no longer add new STAs or update existing standard text ads with Destination URLs. One exception to the rule, is that you can still update the STA status e.g. from *Active* to *Paused*. Otherwise attempts to add or update STAs will result in the *CampaignServiceAdTypeInvalid* error. 
> 
> It is important to note that all your existing STAs will continue to serve alongside EXTAs for the foreseeable future. While there is no date on when STAs will stop serving, you can expect an update to all of our customers well in advance once we make the decision to sunset serving STAs.
