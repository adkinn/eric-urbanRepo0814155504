## <a name="Elements"></a>Elements

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|*AdDistribution*|Determines whether the ads within this ad group will be displayed on the content distribution channel, search distribution channel, or both.<br /><br />**Note:** The content ad distribution channel is not supported for ad groups in Bing Shopping campaigns or Dynamic Search Ads campaigns. <br /><br />**Note:** [!INCLUDE[market_contentads](../campaign-api/includes/market-contentads.md)]<br/><br/>Possible values are *Search* and *Content*. You may include multiple values as flags. How you specify multiple flags depends on the programming language that you use. For example, C# treats these values as flag values and Java treats them as an array of strings. The SOAP element should include a string that contains a space-delimited list of values for example, `<AdDistribution>Search Content</AdDistribution>`.<br /><br />If you include the *Search* distribution, then by default the ad group's *Network* will be set to *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*. You can change the default network as described below.<br /><br />For more information, see [What's the difference between the search and content networks?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52031/0) and [About ad distribution](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50871/0).<br/><br/>**Add:** Required<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[AdDistribution](../campaign-api/addistribution-value-set.md)|
|*AdRotation*|Determines how often you'd like the ads in your ad group to show in relation to one another. If you have multiple ads within an ad group, your ads will rotate because no more than one ad from your account can show at a time.<br /><br />**Note:** This feature is not supported for ad groups in Bing Shopping campaigns.<br/><br/>Possible values are *OptimizeForClicks* and *RotateAdsEvenly*. <br/><br/>If set to *OptimizeForClicks*, [!INCLUDE[brand](../campaign-api/includes/brand.md)] will predominantly show ads that have the highest click-through rate (CTR).<br/><br/>If set to *RotateAdsEvenly*, [!INCLUDE[brand](../campaign-api/includes/brand.md)] will rotate between your ads on an equal basis. That is, each ad in a particular ad group has an equal chance of being displayed in response to a searcher's query. Sometimes the ads that get the highest CTR are not the ads that get the highest conversions. Using *RotateAdsEvenly*, you can help ensure that ads with a higher CTR don't unintentionally get precedence over ads with a higher conversion rate. Also if you want to test new ad copy, using *RotateAdsEvenly* can help ensure that those new ads get an opportunity to be displayed, even if you have other ads within the same ad group that have an established and higher CTR performance history.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. The default value is *OptimizeForClicks*.<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[AdRotation](../campaign-api/adrotation-data-object.md)|
|*BiddingScheme*|The bid strategy type for how you want to manage your bids.<br/><br/>For ad groups you can use either of the [InheritFromParentBiddingScheme](../campaign-api/inheritfromparentbiddingscheme-data-object.md) or [ManualCpcBiddingScheme](../campaign-api/manualcpcbiddingscheme-data-object.md) objects.<br/><br/>[!INCLUDE[autobid_alert](../campaign-api/includes/autobid-alert.md)]<br /><br />[!INCLUDE[tip_biddingscheme](../campaign-api/includes/tip-biddingscheme.md)]<br /><br />**Note:** For campaigns of type *Shopping* the product partitions inherit the ad group *BiddingScheme*, and you must be in the Bing Shopping Enhanced CPC pilot. The pilot ID is 340. <br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this element, then [InheritFromParentBiddingScheme](../campaign-api/inheritfromparentbiddingscheme-data-object.md) is used by default.<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[BiddingScheme](../campaign-api/biddingscheme-data-object.md)|
|*ContentMatchBid*|The bid to use when the keywords that the service extracts from the content page and the ad group’s keywords match by using an exact match comparison. An exact match results when all of the words in the keyword exactly match the user's query.<br /><br />**Note:** This feature is not supported for ad groups in Bing Shopping campaigns or Dynamic Search Ads campaigns.<br/><br/>The minimum and maximum bid range depends on the account's currency. For more information, see [Currencies](~/concepts/currencies.md).<br /><br />You can set a content match bid if the *AdDistribution* value includes *Content*.<br /><br />Specifying a content match bid at the keyword level overrides the ad group’s content match bid value.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set a bid, it will be set to the minimum depending on your account's currency. <br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[Bid](../campaign-api/bid-data-object.md)|
|*EndDate*|The date that the ads in the ad group will expire.<br /><br />If you do not specify an end date, the ads will not expire. The end date can be extended to make an ad group's ads eligible for delivery, even after the ad group expires.<br /><br />The end date is inclusive. For example, if you set *EndDate* to 12/31/2020, the ads in the ad group will expire at 11:59 PM on 12/31/2020. The time is based on the time zone that you specify at the campaign level.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. To set no end date when adding an ad group, set the *EndDate* element to null.<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)] To delete the existing end date setting, and effectively set no end date when updating an ad group, set the *EndDate* element to a date equal to or later than January 2, 2050. When you retrieve the ad group next time, this element will be nil i.e. it will not be set to January 2, 2050.|[Date](../campaign-api/date-data-object.md)|
|*ForwardCompatibilityMap*|The list of key and value strings for forward compatibility. This element can be used to avoid otherwise breaking changes when new elements are added in future releases.<br /><br />**Note:** Forward compatibility changes will be noted here in future releases. There are currently no forward compatibility changes for the *AdGroup* object.|*KeyValuePairOfstringstring* array|
|*Id*|The system generated identifier of the ad group.<br/><br/>**Add:** Not allowed.<br/>**Update:** Read-only and Required|*long*|
|*Language*|The language of the ads and keywords in the ad group.<br/><br/>For possible values, see [Ad Languages](~/concepts/ad-languages.md).<br/><br/>**Note:** For ad groups in Dynamic Search Ads campaigns, only *English* is supported.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** Support for multiple languages at the campaign level is in pilot. If languages are set at both the ad group and campaign level, the ad group-level language will override the campaign-level language. The customer is enabled for the pilot if the [GetCustomerPilotFeatures](~/customer-api/getcustomerpilotfeatures-service-operation.md) response includes pilot number *310*. Pilot participants will be able to set multiple languages at the campaign level, and during update will be able to delete the ad group level language by specifying an empty string value (*""*). If you leave this element nil, then the ad group language will not be updated. If your application depends on ad group language being set, then you must prepare for the possibility that ad group language will be nil. More specific dates and implementation details will be provided later through the [Bing Ads API Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bing_ads_api/), and in the meantime you should update your application right away to support the change.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional if the campaign has one or more languages set, and otherwise language is required.<br/>**Update:** Optional if the customer is in the *Campaign Languages* pilot, and otherwise update is not allowed. If you are not in the pilot and try to change the language during update, an error will be returned.|*string*|
|*Name*|The name of the ad group.<br/><br/>The name must be unique among all active ad groups within the campaign. The name can contain a maximum of 128 characters.<br/><br/>**Add:** Required<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|*string*|
|*NativeBidAdjustment*|The percent amount by which to adjust your bid for native ads above or below the base ad group or keyword bid.<br/><br/>**Note:** [!INCLUDE[pilot_comingsoon](../campaign-api/includes/pilot-comingsoon.md)]<br /><br />Supported values are negative one hundred (-100) through positive nine hundred (900). Setting the bid adjustment to -100 percent will prevent native ads from showing for this ad group.<br /><br />Set this element to zero (0) if you do not want any bid adjustment for native ads. If this element is null you will inherit the *NativeBidAdjustment* setting of the ad group's [Campaign](../campaign-api/campaign-data-object.md).<br /><br />**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional. This property will only be updated if you also set the *UpdateNativeBidAdjustment* element of the [UpdateAdGroups](../campaign-api/updateadgroups-service-operation.md) request message to *true*, and otherwise this property will be ignored. If the ad group already has a native bid adjustment, and you want to remove it to effectively inherit the *NativeBidAdjustment* setting of the ad group's [Campaign](../campaign-api/campaign-data-object.md), set this element to null.|*int*|
|*Network*|The search networks where you want your ads to display.<br /><br />Possible values are *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*, *OwnedAndOperatedOnly*, and *SyndicatedSearchOnly*. <br /><br />You must not set *Network* if the *AdDistribution* is set to *Content*, otherwise an error will be returned.<br /><br />If you select one of the syndicated search options, you can call the [SetNegativeSitesToAdGroups](../campaign-api/setnegativesitestoadgroups-service-operation.md) or [SetNegativeSitesToCampaigns](../campaign-api/setnegativesitestocampaigns-service-operation.md) operation to prevent the ads from displaying on specific syndicated search websites.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. The default is *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*.<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[Network](../campaign-api/network-value-set.md)|
|*PricingModel*|The only supported pricing model in [!INCLUDE[brand](../campaign-api/includes/brand.md)] is based on cost per click (CPC).<br /><br />With *Cpc*, each time the user clicks your ad, the service charges your account based on your bid. The actual charge is based on the auction results and may be less than your bid value.<br/><br/>You are not allowed to set this value to *Cpm*.<br/><br/>**Note:** This field is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the Bing Ads API.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. The pricing model will be set to *Cpc* by default.<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[PricingModel](../campaign-api/pricingmodel-value-set.md)|
|*RemarketingTargetingSetting*|The targeting setting that is applicable for all audiences e.g., custom audiences and remarketing lists that are associated with this ad group. Each audience can be associated with multiple ad groups, and each ad group's remarketing targeting setting is applied independently for delivery.<br/><br/>Possible values are *TargetAndBid* and *BidOnly*. <br/><br/>Set this element to *TargetAndBid* if you want to show ads only to people included in the audience, with the option to change the bid amount. Ads in this ad group will only show to people included in the audience.<br/><br/>Set this element to *BidOnly* if you want to show ads to people searching for your ad, with the option to change the bid amount for people included in the audience. Ads in this ad group can show to everyone but the bid adjustment will apply to people included in the audience.<br /><br />**Note:** This element is not returned in the *AdGroup* object by default. You must include *RemarketingTargetingSetting* in the optional *ReturnAdditionalFields* flags when calling [GetAdGroupsByCampaignId](../campaign-api/getadgroupsbycampaignid-service-operation.md) and [GetAdGroupsByIds](../campaign-api/getadgroupsbyids-service-operation.md).<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. The default value is *BidOnly*.<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[RemarketingTargetingSetting](../campaign-api/remarketingtargetingsetting-value-set.md)|
|*SearchBid*|The default bid to use when the user’s query and the ad group’s keywords match by using either a broad, exact, or phrase match comparison.<br/><br/>The minimum and maximum bid range depends on the account's currency. For more information, see [Currencies](~/concepts/currencies.md).<br /><br />You can set a search bid if the *AdDistribution* value includes *Search*.<br /><br />Specifying a broad, exact, or phrase match bid at the keyword level overrides the ad group’s search bid value for the corresponding match type.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set a bid, it will be set to the minimum depending on your account's currency. <br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[Bid](../campaign-api/bid-data-object.md)|
|*Settings*|Reserved for future use.|[Setting](../campaign-api/setting-data-object.md) array|
|*StartDate*|The date that the ads in the ad group can begin serving; otherwise, the service can begin serving the ads in the ad group the day that the ad group becomes active.<br /><br />The start date cannot be updated after the ad group is submitted.<br /><br />The start date is inclusive. For example, if you set *StartDate* to 11/5/2016, the ads in the ad group will start at 12:00 AM on 11/5/2016. The time is based on the time zone that you specify at the campaign level.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set the start date, then it will default to today's date and the service can begin serving the ads in the ad group as soon as the ad group status is active.<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|[Date](../campaign-api/date-data-object.md)|

|*TrackingUrlTemplate*|The tracking template to use as a default for all URLs in your ad group.<br /><br />[!INCLUDE[validationrules_trackingurltemplate](../campaign-api/includes/validationrules-trackingurltemplate.md)]<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** [!INCLUDE[update_optional_setting_unchanged](../campaign-api/includes/update-optional-setting-unchanged.md)]|*string*|
|*UrlCustomParameters*|Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.<br /><br />You may include up to 3 individual [CustomParameter](../campaign-api/customparameter-data-object.md) objects within the [CustomParameters](../campaign-api/customparameters-data-object.md) object.
