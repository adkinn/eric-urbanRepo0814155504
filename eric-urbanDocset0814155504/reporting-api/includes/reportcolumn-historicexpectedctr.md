Historic average of expected click-through rate scores going back as far as 18 months from the current date. This score may vary from the score in the *ExpectedCtr* column, which is the current score and same value for each day in the time period.

The score for each row is the score that was calculated for expected CTR on that date. For example, if you specify a time period that spans three days, the historic expected CTR score for day one will be the expected CTR score calculated on day one, the historic expected CTR score for day two will be the expected CTR score calculated on day two, and so on.

You may include this column only with Daily aggregation.
