The estimated number of times that an ad could be clicked by a particular age group or gender, divided by the total number of estimated clicks across the ad group (including estimated clicks for unknown age & gender demographics). The value is expressed as a percent from 0 - 100.

**Note**: This value is an estimate because the age and gender is not known for the entire audience.
