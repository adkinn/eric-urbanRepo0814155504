Determines whether you want the service to generate the report only if all the data has been processed and is available.<br /><br />If *True*, the request fails if the system has not finished processing all the data based on the aggregation, scope, and time period values that you specify. However, if *False*, the request succeeds but the report will contain only the data that the system has finished processing at the time of the request (there is no indication as to whether the data is complete). The default is *False*.<br /><br />**Note**: When a user clicks an ad, it can take from three to four hours for the system to process the click and make it available for reporting. For more information, see [Determining When the Books Close](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691014).<br /><br />Because you cannot retrieve complete data for today, you must set this element to *False* if the end date of the custom date range specified in the Time element of the derived report object is set to today, or if you specify one of the following predefined time values:<br />- *Today*<br />- *ThisWeek*<br />- *ThisMonth*<br />- *ThisYear*
