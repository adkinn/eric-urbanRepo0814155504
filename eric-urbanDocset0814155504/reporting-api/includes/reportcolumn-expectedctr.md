How well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. Ads that are relevant to searchers' queries or other input are more likely to have a higher click-through rate. This metric tells you if a keyword is underperforming and causing a loss in impression share, so you can make keyword changes or remove ads altogether.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

**Note**: Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.
