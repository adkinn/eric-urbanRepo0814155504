# Campaign Negative Location Criterion
Defines a campaign negative location criterion that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

Although location criterions are most often used to designate the specific locations where you want to show your ads, [!INCLUDE[brand](../bulk-api/includes/brand.md)] also lets you specify locations you want to exclude from seeing your ads.

Each negative location criterion defines a location code where you do not want your ads to show. 

The maximum number of combined location and negative location criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is 10,000. 

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For a *Campaign Negative Location Criterion* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](../bulk-api/bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Status](#status)
- [Sub Type](#subtype)
- [Target](#target)

You can download all fields of the *Campaign Negative Location Criterion* record by including the [DownloadEntity](../bulk-api/downloadentity-value-set.md) value of *CampaignTargetCriterions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](../bulk-api/downloadcampaignsbyaccountids-service-operation.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](../bulk-api/downloadcampaignsbycampaignids-service-operation.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](../bulk-api/datascope-value-set.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bing-ads-bulk-download-and-upload-guide.aspx).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new campaign negative location criterion if a valid campaign identifier (*Parent Id*) is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Client Id,Modified Time,Target,Bid Adjustment,Name,Radius,Unit,From Hour,From Minute,To Hour,To Minute,Latitude,Longitude
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,
Campaign Negative Location Criterion,,,-111,PostalCode,,ClientIdGoesHere,,79381,,,,,,,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bing-ads-client-libraries.aspx) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkCampaignNegativeLocationCriterion* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCampaignNegativeLocationCriterion
var bulkCampaignNegativeLocationCriterion = new BulkCampaignNegativeLocationCriterion
{
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    CampaignName = null,

    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // BiddableCampaignCriterion object of the Campaign Management service.

    CampaignCriterion = new NegativeCampaignCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        CampaignId = campaignIdKey,

        Criterion = new LocationCriterion
        {
            // 'Target' column header in the Bulk file
            LocationId = 79381,

            // 'Sub Type' column header in the Bulk file
            LocationType = "PostalCode"
        },

        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = CampaignCriterionStatus.Active,
    }
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCampaignNegativeLocationCriterion);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

You must either specify an existing campaign identifier, or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Campaign](../bulk-api/campaign.md) record. This is recommended if you are adding new criterions to a new campaign in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bing-ads-bulk-file-schema.aspx#referencekeys).
