# Campaigns
The [!INCLUDE[brand](../concepts/includes/brand.md)] API provides access to all of your campaign settings, including ads, keywords, ad extensions, and targets. For an introduction to the account and campaign hierarchy within a customer, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](../concepts/entity-hierarchy-and-limits.md).

|Topic|Description|
|---------|---------------|
|[Budget and Bid Opportunities](../concepts/budget-and-bid-opportunities.md)|Get suggestions for new keywords, estimated bids by ad result position, estimated position by bid, and historical marketplace performance for potential new keywords.|
|[Budget and Bid Strategies](../concepts/budget-and-bid-strategies.md)|Before your ads can run, you need to set your campaign’s budget. You'll also need to choose a bid strategy type, and optionally set keyword level match type bids. |
|[Bulk Download and Upload](../concepts/bulk-download-and-upload.md)|Download and upload campaign data in bulk asynchronously in the background.|
|[Labels](../concepts/labels.md)|Labels let you organize campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords into groups based on whatever is important to you. You can then filter and run reports on your labels to get the data that is most meaningful to you.|
|[Negative Keywords](../concepts/negative-keywords.md)|A negative keyword is a specific word or phrase that helps to prevent your ad from being displayed to customers who are unlikely to click your ad. You can use negative keywords to prevent your ad from being displayed if the user’s search query contains one of your negative keywords.|
|[Show Ads to Your Target Audience](../concepts/show-ads-to-your-target-audience.md)|Target your ads to display to users of a certain age group, display on certain days of the week, or display to users in a particular geographical area.|
|[Universal Event Tracking](../concepts/universal-event-tracking.md)|Universal event tracking (UET) tags record what customers do on your website, and then Bing Ads starts collecting that data allowing you to track conversions (like purchases or leads) or target audiences using remarketing lists.|
|[Upgrade Targets to Criterions](../concepts/upgrade-targets-to-criterions.md)|Instead of using targets to show your ads based on age, day and time, device, gender, and location, starting with Bing Ads API version 11 you must use criterions. Where necessary to distinguish from other criterion types the documentation may refer to these entities as *target criterions*.|
|[URL Tracking with Upgraded URLs](../concepts/url-tracking-with-upgraded-urls.md)|URL tracking allows you to find out how people got to your website by adding tracking parameters in Bing Ads and then using a third-party tracking tool or service to analyze the data. When an ad is served, the tracking parameters are dynamically appended to your landing page URL. This landing page URL is recorded on your web server and then a third-party tracking tool, like Adobe or Google Analytics, can interpret the data.<br/><br/>If you have set up tracking in Bing Ads by adding URL parameters to your destination URLs, you will be interested in Upgraded URLs. Upgraded URLs separate the landing page URL from the tracking or URL parameters so if you want to edit your URL parameters, your ad doesn't have to go through another editorial review. It also allows you to define a separate mobile landing page URL if you have a website that is optimized for smaller devices.|
