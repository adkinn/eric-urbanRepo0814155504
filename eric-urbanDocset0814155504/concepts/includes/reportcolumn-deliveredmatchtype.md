The match type used to deliver an ad. This can be different from the *BidMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=627130).

The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.

**Note**: For Reporting API version 9, the column name in the downloaded report is *MatchType*, not *DeliveredMatchType*.
