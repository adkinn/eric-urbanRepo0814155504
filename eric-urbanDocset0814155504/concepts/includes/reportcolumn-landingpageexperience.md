An aggregate quality assessment of all landing pages on your site. The landing page experience score measures whether your landing page is likely to provide a good experience to customers who click your ad and land on your website.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

**Note**: Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.
